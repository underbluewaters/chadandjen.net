          After six happy years together we're getting married on October 1st
          at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History.

          Jen and I first met in 2004
          while studying abroad in Australia. We spent many long field trips 
          together talking on the bus, but were so busy having fun on our 
          adventures that we didn't really start to appreciate each other 
          romantically until we got back home. 
          <em>Though 
          maybe Jen knew something I didn't</em>

          I ran into Jen on campus one day, and despite my seriously unkept 
          college senior look at the time she took me up on an offer to catch 
          up at a party my roommates were throwing for a friend. We went on a 
          date soon after to the zoo and have been inseparable ever since.
        %p
          We'll be using this site to keep you informed about the various 
          details of our wedding like directions, room blocks and registry. 
          It's also a good place to share fun stuff from the wedding like 
          photos and videos from our photographer and home-made photo booth.
